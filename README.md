# Dependency Injection and Inversion of Control (IoC) in C#
This project, originally created in Farsi as a solution file for a course, delves into the fundamental concepts of Dependency Injection (DI) and Inversion of Control (IoC) within the context of C#. The project serves as a valuable resource for understanding and implementing these critical software design patterns.

# Features
- Understanding DI and IoC Principles: Gain a comprehensive understanding of Dependency Injection and Inversion of Control, essential for building maintainable and loosely coupled software applications.
- Practical Implementation in C#: Explore practical implementations of DI and IoC using C#, demonstrating how to decouple components, manage dependencies, and improve testability and scalability.
- Course Solution in Farsi: Utilize the provided course solution file in Farsi, allowing Persian-speaking audiences to grasp the concepts more effectively.
